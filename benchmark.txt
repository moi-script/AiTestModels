1. Generator / Subject Model

Purpose: The AI being tested.
Role: Produces outputs for tasks like OCR, reasoning, coding, or summarization.
Example: tngtech/deepseek-r1t2-chimera:free generating OCR-parsed text.



2. Judge / Evaluator Model

Purpose: Scores or evaluates outputs of the generator.
Role: Assesses accuracy, completeness, reasoning quality, format, bias, etc.
Example: GPT-4o-mini evaluating OCR or reasoning outputs independently.



3. Reference / Ground Truth Model

Purpose: Provides the “correct” answer or ideal reference output.
Role: Acts as a baseline for comparison to generator outputs.
Example: Verified human-annotated OCR results or expert solutions. // source from input




4. Rate-Limiter / Controller

Purpose: Controls the pacing of requests to avoid API throttling.
Role: Implements adaptive backoff, concurrency limits, queues, and request tracking.
Example: Adaptive exponential backoff, per-model limiter, sliding window tracking.



5. Synthesizer / Multi-Model Combiner (Optional)

Purpose: Combines outputs from multiple generators.
Role: Produces a unified output for judging or identifies disagreements between models.
Example: Merging OCR outputs from DeepSeek and Tesseract before scoring.



6. Validator / Schema Checker

Purpose: Ensures the output format and content are correct.
Role: Checks JSON keys, types, value ranges, grammar, or hallucinations.
Example: Confirming OCR output is _{"store":"..."}_ and all fields exist.




7. Analyzer / Statistics Engine

Purpose: Aggregates and analyzes results.
Role: Measures consistency, variance, prompt sensitivity, bias, token efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
Example: Computing averages, standard deviations, performance over multiple runs.
