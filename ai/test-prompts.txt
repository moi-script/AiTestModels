1. A Full-Spectrum Test Suite
The benchmark isn't just a single pop quiz. It’s more like a decathlon, covering:


Math Whizzes: Can they solve those tricky train meeting point problems?
Deep Thinkers: How well do they analyze something complex, like "Element X"?
Code Monkeys: Can they whip up a palindrome checker?
Pattern Spotters: Are they good at deciphering letter sequences?
Knowledge Banks: What do they know about black holes?
Ethical Navigators: How do they reason about AI bias in loan systems?
2. Clever Rate Limiting
Even Openrouter's free models have drawbacks in the form of rate limits. I couldn't just keep bombing messages at their API, as that was a sure fire way to be hit with limits. So to keep things running smoothly, the tool has an adaptive rate limiting system:

Starts with a 1-second pause.
If it hits a wall, it backs off exponentially (doubling the wait time).
Maxes out at a 60-second pause.
Tries up to 10 times for each request.
Gives up on a single request after 180 seconds.
Rate limits are usually Request Per Minute (RPM) so there was no point backing off beyond the 60s mark. I did also learn a hard lesson that less can sometimes be more. In my eagerness to complete all of the tests the app was originally multi-threaded, but I quickly realised this WAS a sure fire way to be rate limited.

3. Fair and Square Judging
Every response gets a score based on:


Accuracy: Did it get the answer right?
Completeness: Was anything important left out?
Format Savvy: Did it follow instructions on how to answer?
Reasoning Quality: How good was the explanation?
Scores are all normalised to a 0-10 scale.
The Judging Process
To keep things unbiased, I enlisted GPT-4o-mini as an independent evaluator. It was asked to evaluate the responses in a number of areas:


A detailed "why" behind the score.
An error breakdown if things went wrong.
The core criteria for judging were:
Factual correctness.
Thoroughness of the answer.
Logical flow.
Sticking to the task's rules.
Clarity of explanation.
A numerical score (0-10).
